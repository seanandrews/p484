notes from telecon on 2018 / 05 / 07
------------------------------------

participants: Andrews, Birnstiel, Carpenter, Dullemond, Guzman, Hughes, Isella, 
              Oberg, Perez, Ricci, Wilner
unavailable:  Bai, Guzman, Zhu

- update on data calibration:
	- nearly everything is done and on the wiki; we expect the last few 
	  disks (HD 143006, HD 163296, DoAr 25, IM Lup) to be wrapped up within
	  one week

- projects:
	- intention is to publish 10-11 papers in an ApJL "Focus Issue"
		- Sean will contact Fred Rasio about this in June

	- *** FULL DRAFT INTERNAL DEADLINE = AUGUST 1, 2018 ***

	- internal vetting process completed on or before September 1, 2018, 
	  for timely joint submission

	- goal is to get all of this published before the first long-baseline 
	  datasets become public (first half of October)

	- "Projects" wiki page is now up to date:
		- project paper (Sean): covers motivation for the project, the 
		  sample selection and bulk properties, and data calibration

		- rings/gaps (Jane): empirical characterization (locations, 
		  widths, morphologies, symmetry, amplitudes, etc.) and 
	  	  discussion of potential origins
	
		- spirals (Jane): empirical characterization (launching points, 
		  opening angles, extents, bifurcations, etc.) and discussion 
		  of potential origins

		- HD 143006 (Laura): structure, vortex, warps, connection to 
		  SPHERE results, 12CO for morphology / kinematics
			- possible collaborator: Stefano Facchini (MPE/ESO)
	
		- HD 163296 (Andrea): minimal plan is to present new 10 au gap 
		  and "tail" feature in other gap from B6; possible to do the 
	 	  multifrequency analysis folding in B3, B7 data; possible to 
		  do the 12CO at high resolution (need to look at that first)

		- vertical structure (Erik): last tests of raytracing code 
		  before ready to model (HD 142666, MY Lup, DoAr 25); goal is
		  to quantify vertical height of continuum emission layer in 
		  the context of turbulence / vertical mixing

		- AS 209 structure (Viviana): simple modeling of rings for a 
	  	  detailed look at structure; intend preliminary CO analysis

		- dust evolution in rings (Kees): now thinking of two papers, 
		  the first is an analytic look at "single" pressure traps and 
		  using the profile morphology to learn about the trapped size
		  distribution (with some interesting connections / constraints
		  on streaming instability); the second is another 1-D model 
		  that uses analytic gap profiles for planets to learn about 
		  trapping in that specific context

		- hydro limits on planet population (Zhaohuan): suite of hydro 
	 	  models to look at the planet population as a whole for this 
	 	  sample [Zhaohuan will have to explain in more detail.]

		- AS 205 and HT Lup (Nico): empirical characterization of these 
	 	  two triple systems; current plan is to include them together, 
		  and present the AS 205 gas data (HT Lup 12CO is contaminated)

	- Sean will add individual wiki pages associated with each Project; 
	  please dump notes and figures (and / or effectively "blog") in there

	- Sean will post homogenized set of stellar parameters to the wiki
	
	- Laura will send Sean SED information, and (eventually) Sean will post
	  SEDs for each target on the wiki

- Future telecons:
	- We will meet next on *TUESDAY*, May 22 at 2:00pm EDT.  The plan is to
	  meet every other week now.
