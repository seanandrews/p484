- update on data delivery:
	- now have 13/20 datasets in hand
	- update from NAASC on 12/22:
		- RU Lup, Sz 129 went into pipeline on 12/20
		- IM Lup had some problem in pipeline; now manual
		- HD 143006, Sz 114, AS 205, DoAr 25 need JAO to "time out":
			- HD 143006 has 2x EBs, but only 1.78 rate
			- John says this hasn't quite been done, but should be 
			  settled this week; we're unclear on timescale for 
			  delivery after that (quick, or back in pipeline?)
		- DoAr 25 has a semipass EB too; will be delivered raw, but we 
		  might want to do a manual calibration
	 
- update on data calibration:
	- preliminary combined calibrations for ~9 targets
	- some pitfalls identified, but generally data are in good shape
		- check flux cal, look out for subtle astrometric shifts 
		  (especially in cases where there's a large distance to phase
		  calibrator; Oph disks generally in good shape)
	- I have updated calibration wiki:
		- check that your roles are up to date
		- Andrea, Laura will get new data staged later this week
		  (Jane on vacation, and we're running into space issues)
		- if you can, feel free to volunteer as a 2nd reducer (just 
	 	  replace one with my name on it)
	- We will have a more detailed telecon discussion on calibration issues
	  sometime in January; exact date / time TBD 
	- goals:
		- >60% of sample with analysis-ready products by next telecon
		- 100% of sample with analysis-ready products by end of Feb
		- if you can't meet goals you've signed up (and please be 
		  realistic), let me know ASAP: its fine, but we need to be on 
		  top of it sooner rather than later

- science / preparation:
	- Zhaohuan planet-disk interaction simulations
		- FARGO + particle; various masses (Earths to Jupiters), alpha
		- large alpha --> ring structure gets wider (gap depth and ring
		  width correlated, tells you about diffusion); if alpha < 1e-3
		  rings are unresolved
		- lots of vortices: polygon features (m = 5, 6 mode) from RWI 
		  in linear stage, but they don't last long
	- Kees / Til thoughts on their meeting last month
		- setup made; ready to investigate dust evolution in rings
		- simple procedure, but ~10s per setup (gas pressure profile + 
		  alpha), so can fit and study general behavior without a fixed
		  reason for perturbations (i.e., planets in mind, but can be 
		  generalized for other cases)
		- some discussion of details: Zhaohuan should be in the loop!
		- looking at AS 209: FWHM of outer rings is 2-3 beams, means 
		  there is hope for degenerate limit on alpha, grain sizes
	- Viviana playing with Gaussian ring models for AS 209 (by eye):
		- getting hexagonal shape in simulations (PSF artifact)
		- Kees: wouldn't expect "aligned" hexagons, since they should 
		  move at different rates at different distances from star

- misc:
	- Andrea: AS 205 hydro simulations (Shangfei Liu); will update in Feb
	- start preparing for proposals (first discussions in Feb)
