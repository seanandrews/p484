INSTALLATION
------------

radmc3dPy can be installed in two ways:

1) Standard python install with distutils (sudo/root privileges are needed)

    $>python setup.py install

This will install radmc3dPy to the standard python directory (/usr/..../site-packages or
    /opt/..../site-packages for a standard python installation in most unix/linux systems)

2) Manual install

    Add the directory where this file is located to the PYTHONPATH environment variable, and
    that is it. The best way to do so is in the .bashrc or .csrc files so it will automatically
    be loaded at every shell startup. I.e. for bash add the following line to the 
    .bashrc file

    export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:ABSOLUTE-PATH-TO-THIS-DIRECTORY

    or for c-shell add the following line to the .csrc file:

    setenv PYTHONPATH ${PYTHONPATH}:ABSOLUTE-PATH-TO-THIS-DIRECTORY

   
REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

radmc3dPy relies on several auxiliary but widely used python packages:

    matplotlib      - used for visualization/plotting
    numpy           - used for array operations
    astropy.io.fits - previously known as PyFits, ython library for fits file handling
