This is a set of scripts to extract the radial profile from the
observations. The main tricky part is the fitting of the inclination.  See the
document fitincl/fitincl.pdf for the explanation.

The other directories contain the scripts for the specific sources.
Example usage:

cd GW_Lup
ipython --matplotlib
%run extract_radial.py

It asks you whether you want to recompute the (r,phi) image. For the first time
you run this script, you must type 'y', because it has to extract the (r,phi)
image from the fits file, which has (x,y) coordinates. This takes a while, but
the result is written to file. So the next time you run the script, you can say
'n' and you skip this step, saving you time.

Next you get a widget where you can do an initial by-eye fit, which serves as
the intial condition for the MCMC fit. To start the MCMC fit you simply click on
the close window button, and the MCMC run begins.

Once the MCMC run is finished, the most likely inclination and position angle are
taken to deproject the image. Next the radial profile is determined. These are
saved to ascii files:

GW_Lup_radial_tbright.txt          --> Contains the full (non-linear) brightness temperature
GW_Lup_radial_tbright_linear.txt   --> Contains the linear (RJ) brightness temperature

You also see various plots popping up, which are also saved to PDF.

Note that the center of the image is usually determined automatically by finding
the brightest pixel. But in some cases that does not work well, in which case
the center is determined by hand.

Note also that I renamed the sources in the following way: AS209 --> AS_209,
etc, and also the fits files. Sorry about that...

For HD 143006 I cut out the blob.
